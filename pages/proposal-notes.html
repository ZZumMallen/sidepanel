								<b>Apple Scab</b>
								<br>
								The following recommendation is for the treatment control and management of the fungal disease apple scab in the
								spring,
								during the development of the new leaf tissue. This is one of the most common diseases that impact our beautiful
								spring
								flowering trees. Timing is critical in the control of the spores, and we have a team that tracks the precise
								timing of
								application. Untreated trees typically will show signs of the spores in the leaf tissue early in the summer
								months with
								browning leaves beginning to fall from the trees creating a panic that the trees are dying as they tend to
								defoliate up
								to 65-70% of the canopy in the middle of the summer. This creates stress for the tree and if the cycle repeats
								yearly,
								it can jeopardize the tree&#8217s future health.

								The delivery of this service is injected into the soil at the depth of 6-8 inches below grade in the area where
								the tree roots are most active in supporting the health and vigor of the tree. We deliver this in a complete

								under the entire canopy of the tree 18-24 inches on center to maximize the root&apos;s ability to absorb and use
								for
								resources.

								<b>Plant Health Care</b>
								<br>
								The following recommendations are for plant health care services as listed above. In many cases, these
								recommendations are for the long-term protection and care of the health and vigor of our urban trees which are
								based on best
								management practices. When it comes to the management of insects and diseases that compromise the health of the
								trees,
								it is critical to not only maintain their health and wellness but to also prescribe the proper treatment
								measures
								as urban trees tend to have increased stress factors.
								<br>
								As stewards of the urban forest and our environment we will always put our best foot forward in our approach
								to managing the health of these trees by utilizing protocols that provide predictable results with the least
								harm to
								non-target organisms. We accomplish this through soil-injected treatments while reducing spray treatments as
								much as
								possible. There are some cases that require foliar treatments that are specifically targeted to manage certain
								pests.
								Our objective is to protect and preserve our urban forest and the long-term health of the canopies that provide
								so much value, in so many ways.

								<b>Soil Care</b>
								<br>
								The following recommendations are for soil care and root health management in our urban soils. These
								services are the best practices that one can implement for the long-term sustainability of our urban trees. As
								we look at
								soils after development, they are typically less than ideal for successful growth of healthy trees.
								<br>
								In the commercial landscape a high percentage of planted tree&apos;s root collar or &quot;heart&quot; is below
								the soil
								line (grade). This can lead to stem girdling roots which are roots that grow around the base of the tree(s)
								causing
								compression on the vessels of the tree resulting in poor distribution of both water and nutrients throughout the
								tree.
								<br>
								Root Enhancement System (RES) is performed with a specialized tool called an air spade designed to
								de-compact tough soils and expose roots that need surgery. A way to look at this service is the analogy of
								&quot;open heart
								surgery&quot; to trees. We remove roots that are compromising the tree&apos;s future and mimic the natural
								forest floor by adding in rich
								organic matter, bio char and a top layer of mulch.
								<br>
								Root Collar Excavation (RCE) could be best described as the old variety of &quot;exploratory heart
								surgery.&quot; We
								visually can see the issue however we do not fully understand the extent of the concern until we can expose the
								root
								flare of the tree and begin the process.

								<b>Structural Pruning</b>
								<br>
								The following recommendations are for structural pruning. In landscape settings, trees often develop
								multiple trunks (called leaders) in response to abundant light. The growth of multiple trunks or leaders can
								shorten the
								life span of landscape trees due to weak structure and limb breakage.

								Cambistat is a soil applied growth regulator that is absorbed through the roots. Cambistat gently slows the
								growth of trees, allowing the tree to redirect some of its energy from canopy growth to defense chemicals,
								fibrous
								root production, and other uses. The resulting reallocation of energy makes your tree healthier and more
								durable.
